## 👋 Hi, I'm Wenyang Cao

### ✨ About Me
I’m someone who genuinely enjoys digging into data and figuring out what it’s trying to tell us.  
I like solving problems, spotting patterns, and turning messy information into something clear and useful.  
I'm curious by nature, detail-oriented, and always up for learning something new—especially if it helps make things more efficient or insightful.
